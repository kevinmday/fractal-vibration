Fractal Vibration Therapy
This is a simple web app that uses your phone's vibration feature to deliver fractal-patterned vibration pulses.
Designed as an experimental tool for therapeutic stimulation, such as easing osteoarthritis symptoms in the hands by applying fractal waveforms.
---
How It Works
- The app generates vibration pulses based on a fractal recursion pattern (using the Sierpinski triangle principle).
- Each vibration sequence recursively triggers smaller vibrations, creating a layered, fractal rhythm.
- You activate the vibrations by pressing the Start Vibration button.
- The vibration pattern is intended to stimulate nerves and tissues in a unique, potentially therapeutic way.

Usage
1. Scan QR.
2. Tap Start Vibration to begin the fractal vibration pattern.
3. Place your phone against or hold your hand for the vibration therapy.
---
Requirements
- A smartphone with vibration motor (most modern phones).
- A browser that supports the Vibration API (Chrome, Firefox, Edge on mobile).
- Recommended: Quiet environment and comfortable hand placement.
